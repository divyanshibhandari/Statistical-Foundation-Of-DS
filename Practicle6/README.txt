In this practical, a small dataset of teachers’ ratings was used to analyze different factors that may affect teaching evaluations. The dataset includes attributes such as Gender, Age, Beauty Score, Tenure, and Teaching Evaluation Score.

Four statistical tests were performed:

T-Test: To check if there is a significant difference in teaching evaluation scores between male and female instructors.

ANOVA: To determine whether the beauty score of instructors differs significantly across different age groups.

Chi-Square Test: To test if there is an association between an instructor’s tenure and gender.

Correlation Test: To find if there is a relationship between beauty score and teaching evaluation score.

Each test was performed using Python (pandas, scipy) libraries in Jupyter Notebook. The results helped in understanding whether these factors have any significant relationship or impact on one another.

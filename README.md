Practicle1/README.md In this exercise, we created a small artificial dataset containing ages and incomes, with some missing values to simulate real-world incomplete data.

First, we computed the average income, median income, and an age-based weighted average, which gives more importance to certain age groups.

Next, we standardized income values with z-scores and found outliers where values were unusually high or low.

Then, we grouped ages into categories (18–25, 25–35, 35–45, 45–60) and calculated the number of people, mean income, and median income in each group.

Finally, we created a 2D array to explore array properties, indexing, arithmetic operations, and linear algebra functions like determinant and inverse.

This practical helps understand data handling, basic statistics, and array operations in Python using NumPy and Pandas, while also dealing with missing values.

In this practical, the Wine dataset from the sklearn library was analyzed using Python. Basic statistical summaries were generated using the describe()
function to understand the distribution of features. Boxplots were created to compare key chemical properties across different wine classes.
A scatterplot was used to visualize the relationship between two selected variables. The covariance matrix was computed and visualized using a 
heatmap to study relationships between features. The dataset was then scaled using StandardScaler to standardize the feature values.
Finally, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce dimensionality and visualize improved class separation in the transformed 2-D space.

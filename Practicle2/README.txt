In this practical, we explored how students rate their teachers using a small dataset of BTech students. The main goal was to understand the general trends in teacher ratings, examine differences in perception based on gender, and check if tenure status affects teachers differently for males and females.

We analyzed whether the data represents a time-based sequence or a snapshot in time, and concluded it is cross-sectional, as all ratings were collected at a single point without following students or teachers over time.

We calculated basic statistics such as the mean, median, minimum, and maximum values for student ratings to summarize teacher performance. To better understand one variable, we plotted a histogram of the beauty scores to visualize how the ratings are distributed.

Further, we grouped teachers by gender to see if average beauty ratings differ between male and female instructors, and we also calculated the percentage of tenured professors by gender to observe any patterns.

In this practical, we worked with a dataset of BTech students rating their teachers. We identified duplicate instructor records and calculated the average and standard deviation of age for all observations and for unique instructors. We then used bar charts to compare ratings of lower- and upper-division courses, and scatter plots to study the relationship between age and teaching evaluations. Finally, we plotted the same relationship by separating instructors by gender and then by both gender and tenure. This exercise shows how basic statistics and simple plots can provide clear insights into teacher evaluations.

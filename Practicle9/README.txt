This experiment demonstrates the implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm on the Iris dataset to 
classify flower species based on sepal and petal features. The process includes data exploration, feature scaling, 
model training, evaluation, and visualization. By comparing error rates for different K values, the best K was found to be 9, achieving an accuracy of around 95%. 
The results show that KNN effectively classifies data based on proximity, and proper scaling and K selection significantly improve model performance.

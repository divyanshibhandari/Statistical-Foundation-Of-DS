In this practical, the same teacher rating dataset was used to perform simple probability and hypothesis testing.
First, we found the probability of receiving an evaluation score greater than 4.5, and then for scores between 3.5 and 4.2.
Next, a two-tailed z-test was performed to compare the mean scores of professional basketball players with regional players.
The test helped determine whether there was a significant difference between their average performances.
We stated both null and alternative hypotheses, calculated the z-statistic, and made a decision based on critical values.

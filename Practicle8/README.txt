In this practical, a Decision Tree Classifier is built using the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset to predict whether a person has diabetes.
The dataset includes features like Glucose, BMI, Blood Pressure, Age, etc.

The data is divided into independent variables (X) and dependent variable (y), then split into training and testing sets.
A Decision Tree model is trained using the Entropy criterion, which selects the best feature (like Glucose) based on Information Gain.

Finally, the tree is visualized to show how decisions are made.
The model helps understand which factors most influence diabetes prediction and gives a clear, interpretable structure.

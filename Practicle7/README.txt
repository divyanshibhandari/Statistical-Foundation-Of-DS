In this experiment, we analyzed the teachersâ€™ rating dataset using different statistical techniques. First,
a T-Test was used to check if gender affects teaching evaluation scores. Next, Regression with ANOVA was
applied to find whether beauty scores differ across various age groups. Finally, a Correlation analysis was 
conducted to determine the relationship between teaching evaluation and beauty scores.
These tests helped us understand how different factors influence teaching evaluations using Python.

This Python program analyzes sunspot activity using yearly sunspot numbers. It first stores the data in a DataFrame and then applies a 13-month moving 
average to smooth the values. The code detects solar cycle peaks (maximum sunspot activity) by comparing each point with its neighboring values.
Finally, it plots both the raw data and the smoothed curve, marking the identified peaks to show the pattern of the 11-year solar cycle clearly.

In this practical, a simple student rating dataset was created to study teacher-related statistics like age, tenure, gender, and evaluation scores.
We used Python (Pandas and Matplotlib) to calculate different measures and visualize the data.
The analysis included finding the percentage of visible minority professors who are tenured, checking if average age differs by tenure, and identifying which graph type represents the data best.
A histogram was used for the age variable since it clearly shows how values are distributed.
We also compared vertical and horizontal bar charts using gender data, and finally, the median evaluation score of tenured professors was calculated.
